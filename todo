FEATURE LIST FOR v1.2
=====================
1. Create a UUID, Rating, BlowFishHash and Md5Hash Property
2. Write JSON Serialization and Deserialization
3. Add support for proper serialization of DateTime related descriptors : Done

+ Stronger support for other cassandra types, 
+ Write CollectionReference(), to create eventually consistent collections like Mappings, lists and sets.
