FEATURE LIST FOR v1.2
=====================
1. Create a UUID, Rating, BlowFishHash and Md5Hash Property
2. Write JSON Serialization and Deserialization
3. Add support for proper serialization of DateTime related descriptors : Done
4. Default Property validators for Map keys.

+ Stronger support for other cassandra types, 
+ Write CollectionReference(), to create eventually consistent collections like Mappings, lists and sets.
  possibly the easiest way to do this is by making each Property to do its own part in creation and persistence.



'''
DESIGN SCRIPT

An Extensible Wide Row; with inbuilt default validation and serialization
'''

Basic = String(pattern="{Email Regular Expression Here}", length= 50)

@key("id")
class Profile(Model):
    '''Basic Extensible Wide Row'''
    id = UUID()
    bookmarks = Map(Basic, URL)
    default = Default(Basic, Integer)


Or:  

@key("id")
class Profile(Model):
    '''Basic Extensible Wide Row'''
    id = UUID()
    bookmarks = Map(Basic, URL)
    
    @property
    def default(self):
        '''Converters for Dynamic Properties'''
        return Basic, Integer
    
Depending on how you intend to use this.
