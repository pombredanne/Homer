FEATURE LIST
============
1. Create a UUID, Rating, BlowFishHash and Md5Hash Property # Postponed
2. Write JSON Serialization and Deserialization # Postponed

Notes:
Reading and Writing is assymetric right now. 

Plans for v1.2;
+ Stronger support for other cassandra types, 
+ Write CollectionReference(), to create eventually consistent collections like Mappings, lists and sets.
  possibly the easiest way to do this is by making each Property to do its own part in creation and persistence.
