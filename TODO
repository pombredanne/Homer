TODO for Homer SDK
 
1. What if you can check for deleted, modified, added properties even for complex
   embedded objects by decorating or wrapping its special methods when Type(Class) 
   occurs; look at DebugConnection for a Reference...This will allow me to look into
   complex types if they are set with Type(ComplexType)
   
2. Add a Hashable common type that only accepts dict or hashables and decorates
   __setitem__ and __delitem__ to add modification notification.
   
3. Add the Md5Digest,SHADigest Descriptor to commons.
   """ Look up for usage description """

4. Marshalling code like toString() and fromString() should probably be added 
   to DataProperty to support basic unicode based or JSON based serialization.
   wait a minute why not simply use the constructor and __str__; this is consistent
   with the coercion like behaviour of Type()

5. Pycassa uses struct.Struct to pack and unpack binary data to/from cassandra.
   study it and find lazyboy's mechanism ; ####
   
6. I need to understand indexes in cassandra; I think I can find it when I try to
   configure the damned server....study pycassa's implementation too. 
   
7. Add format to commons.DateTime, Time and Date...
